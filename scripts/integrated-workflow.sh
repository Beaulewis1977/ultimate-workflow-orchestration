# Autonomous Development Workflow

## How to Use This Integrated Setup

### 1. Research Phase (Vibe-Coder-MCP)
```bash
# Use Claude Code with Vibe-Coder tools
research "SaaS architecture best practices 2024"
generate-prd "AI-powered task management platform"
curate-context "Gather implementation examples and patterns"
```

### 2. Planning Phase (BMAD-METHOD Agents)
```bash
# Use BMAD slash commands in Claude Code
/analyst "Analyze market for AI-powered SaaS platforms"
/pm "Create comprehensive project roadmap and sprint backlog"
/architect "Design scalable microservices architecture"
/ux-expert "Design modern, responsive user interface"
```

### 3. Autonomous Execution (Tmux-Orchestrator)
```bash
# Connect to orchestrator session
tmux attach-session -t ai-saas-platform-orchestrator

# In the orchestrator session, coordinate BMAD agents:
# "You are the Orchestrator. Coordinate the following BMAD agents across tmux sessions:
#  - Project Manager in session 'ai-saas-platform-pm' 
#  - Backend Developer in session 'ai-saas-platform-backend'
#  - Frontend Developer in session 'ai-saas-platform-frontend' 
#  - QA Engineer in session 'ai-saas-platform-qa'
#  
#  Use the project specification and coordinate autonomous development.
#  Schedule check-ins every 30 minutes and ensure regular git commits."
```

### 4. Monitoring and Control
```bash
# View all project sessions
tmux list-sessions | grep ai-saas-platform

# Attach to specific agent session
tmux attach-session -t ai-saas-platform-pm

# Send messages to agents
./Tmux-Orchestrator/send-claude-message.sh ai-saas-platform-pm "Status update request"

# Schedule automatic check-ins
./Tmux-Orchestrator/schedule_with_note.sh 30 "Check project progress"
```

### 5. Cross-Platform Access
- **WSL**: Monitor tmux sessions and agent activity
- **Windows**: Access files at `C:\bmad-workspace\projects\ai-saas-platform\`
- **Claude Code**: Use BMAD slash commands and Vibe-Coder tools
- **Git**: Track progress with automated commits every 30 minutes

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### Orchestrator Role
- Monitors overall project progress
- Coordinates between specialized agents
- Escalates complex decisions to human oversight
- Manages project timeline and deliverables

### BMAD Agent Specialization
- **Project Manager**: Sprint planning, task assignment, progress tracking
- **Backend Developer**: API development, database design, infrastructure
- **Frontend Developer**: UI/UX implementation, component development
- **QA Engineer**: Testing strategy, quality assurance, security validation

### Integration Benefits
- **24/7 Development**: Agents work continuously in persistent sessions
- **Research-Informed**: Decisions based on latest best practices
- **Quality-First**: Built-in testing and validation workflows
- **Human Oversight**: Regular check-ins and decision points
- **Cross-Platform**: Seamless access from Windows and WSL
