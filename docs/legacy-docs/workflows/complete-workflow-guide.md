## Core Tool Integration

### 1. Vibe-Coder + Tmux Orchestrator Integration

The foundation of the autonomous development system combines project management with session orchestration:

```bash
# Initialize Vibe-Coder project with Tmux integration
mcp__vibe_kanban__create_task project_id="autonomous-dev" title="Initialize Development Environment"

# Start Tmux orchestrator for the project
tmux new-session -d -s autonomous-dev
tmux send-keys -t autonomous-dev "cd /project/workspace" Enter
tmux send-keys -t autonomous-dev "./orchestrator-startup.sh" Enter
```

**Workflow Pattern:**
1. Create project structure in Vibe-Coder
2. Initialize Tmux session with orchestrator
3. Set up automated monitoring and reporting
4. Enable continuous development loops

### 2. BMAD Lifecycle Integration

The Build, Monitor, Analyze, Deploy workflow integrates with all tools:

```bash
# BMAD Integration Workflow
./bmad-workflow.sh --mode=autonomous --integration=full

# Build Phase with Deep Reasoning
mcp__deep-code-reasoning__analyze_task_complexity
mcp__deep-code-reasoning__escalate_analysis

# Monitor Phase with Sequential Thinking
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking_tools

# Analyze Phase with Research Trinity
mcp__perplexity-mcp__perplexity_search_web
mcp__brave-search__brave_web_search
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id
```

### 3. Context7 + Documentation Integration

Seamless documentation and knowledge management:

```bash
# Resolve library documentation
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id libraryName="react"
mcp__context7__get-library-docs context7CompatibleLibraryID="/facebook/react"

# Integrate with project documentation
# Documentation is automatically synced with development progress
```

  });
  
  const techDocs = await mcp__context7__get_library_docs({
    context7CompatibleLibraryID: libraryId,
    topic: extractTechnicalFocus(query)
  });
  
  // Phase 3: Brave Search for current market data
  const marketData = await mcp__brave_search__brave_web_search({
    query: `${query} 2025 trends market analysis`,
    count: 10
  });
  
  // Integration: Sequential Thinking for synthesis
  return await mcp__sequential_thinking__sequentialthinking_tools({
    thought: `Synthesize research from: ${JSON.stringify({
      domainResearch, techDocs, marketData
    })}`,
    total_thoughts: 10,

      "Validation Strategy",
      "Deployment Preparation"
    ]
  }
};

// Example: Complex Feature Development
async function developComplexFeature(featureSpec) {
  const thinkingProcess = await mcp__sequential_thinking__sequentialthinking_tools({
    thought: `Analyze complex feature: ${featureSpec}. Need to break down into implementable components.`,
    total_thoughts: 15,
    thought_number: 1,
    next_thought_needed: true,
    current_step: {
      step_description: "Initial feature analysis and decomposition",
      recommended_tools: [
        {
          tool_name: "mcp__deep-code-reasoning__escalate_analysis",
          confidence: 0.9,
          rationale: "Complex feature requires deep analysis",
          priority: 1
        },
        {
          tool_name: "mcp__context7__resolve-library-id",
          confidence: 0.8,
          rationale: "Need technical documentation for implementation",
          priority: 2
        }
      ],
      expected_outcome: "Clear feature breakdown with implementation strategy"
    }
  });
  
  return thinkingProcess;
}
```

            'research_agent': ResearchTriangleAgent(),
            'development_agent': BMADAgent(),
            'reasoning_agent': DeepReasoningAgent(),
            'thinking_agent': SequentialThinkingAgent(),
            'orchestration_agent': TmuxOrchestratorAgent()
        }
    
    async def execute_collective_workflow(self, project_spec):
        # Phase 1: Collective Research
        research_results = await self.agents['research_agent'].execute_trinity_research(
            project_spec.research_requirements
        )
        
        # Phase 2: Collective Planning
        planning_results = await self.agents['thinking_agent'].execute_sequential_planning(
            project_spec, research_results
        )
        
        # Phase 3: Collective Development
        development_results = await self.agents['development_agent'].execute_bmad_lifecycle(
            planning_results.implementation_plan
        )
        
        # Phase 4: Collective Validation
        validation_results = await self.agents['reasoning_agent'].execute_deep_analysis(
            development_results.artifacts
        )
        
        # Phase 5: Collective Orchestration
        orchestration_results = await self.agents['orchestration_agent'].coordinate_deployment(
            validation_results.deployment_plan
        )
        
        return {
            'research': research_results,
            'planning': planning_results,
            'development': development_results,
